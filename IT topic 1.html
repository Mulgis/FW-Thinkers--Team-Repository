<h1>Cryptocurrency & Blockchain</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

    <br>
        <h4>What are "Cryptocurrencies" and what is "Blockchain"?</h4>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use the blockchain technology to generate more of itself.</p>
    <p>'A blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or  cheat the system.' (EuroMoney, 2020) </p>
    <p>'A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains several transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to the participant’s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger technology. Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.' (EuroMoney, 2020)</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Cryptocurrencies have 3 different ways of being obtained:</p>
    <h4>1.Trading/buying</h4>
    <p>Crypto can be bought and sold online as an investment to make money. Many people have gotten involved in investment of crypto through either direct means such as the buying and selling of it from an exchange or indirect means such as investing in a business or individual that handles these transactions themselves.</p>
    <h4>2.Proof of Work</h4>
    <p>'Proof of work is the original crypto consensus mechanism, first used by bitcoin. Proof of work and mining are closely related ideas. The reason it’s called “proof of work” is because the network requires a huge amount of processing power. Proof-of-work blockchains are secured and verified by virtual miners around the world racing to be the first to solve a math puzzle. The winner gets to update the blockchain with the latest verified transactions and is rewarded by the network with a predetermined amount of crypto.' (coinbase, 2020)</p>
    <p>'Proof of work has some powerful advantages, especially for a relatively simple but hugely valuable cryptocurrency like bitcoin. It’s a proven, robust way of maintaining a secure decentralized blockchain. As the value of a cryptocurrency grows, more miners are incentivized to join the network, increasing its power and security. Because of the amount of processing power involved, it becomes impractical for an individual or group to meddle with a valuable cryptocurrency’s blockchain.' (coinbase, 2020)</p>
  <h4>3.Proof of Stake</h4>
  <p>'In a proof of stake system, staking serves a similar function to proof of work’s mining, in that it’s the process by which a network participant gets selected to add the latest batch of transactions to the blockchain and earn some crypto  in exchange. The exact details vary by project, but in general proof of stake blockchains employ a network of “validators” who contribute, or “stake”, their own crypto in exchange for a chance of getting to validate new transactions, update the blockchain, and earn a reward.' (coinbase, 2020)</p>
  <p>'The network selects a winner based on the amount of crypto each validator has in the pool and the length of time they’ve had it there, literally rewarding the most invested participants. Once the winner has validated the latest block of transactions, other validators can attest that the block is accurate. When a threshold number of attestations have been made, the network updates the blockchain. All participating validators receive a reward in the native cryptocurrency, which is generally distributed by the network in proportion to each validator’s stake.' (coinbase, 2020)</p>
  <br>
  <div class="mem">
  <p>'Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track Bitcoin wherever it goes.' (Hayes, 2022) </p>
  <p>'For example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, where those who kept Bitcoin on the exchange lost everything. While the hacker may be entirely anonymous, the Bitcoins that they extracted are easily traceable. If the Bitcoins stolen in some of these hacks were to be moved or spent somewhere, it would be known.' (Hayes, 2022)</p>

  <h3>Probable future impacts of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain </h3>
  <br>
  <p>Here are some of the potential impacts of the growth of crypto and blockchain technology:</p>
  <br>
  <p>1.	More jobs being created that involve working with and understanding the technology. An example of one of these is a person who is to evaluate the crypto market and advise purchases and investments into different crypto currencies.</p>
  <p>2.	Reduction of paperwork in retail and increasing accountability. The use of blockchain technology to document information helps in stopping anyone from duplicating sensitive information or forging evidence. It can also help with reducing the paperwork associated with buying and selling through keeping a record of transactions itself.</p>
  <p>3.	Government adoption of the technology. Government adoption of crypto and blockchain would take power away from banks as the currency exists in a digital space and can’t be controlled by a single entity.</p>
  <p>4.	Cryptocurrencies are very volatile due to the constant spikes and drops in the value of each crypto coin. Most recently, Ethereum, the 2nd most popular crypto coin, has had a huge spike with the value going from 383.68 per coin in October of 2020 to 4426.74 per coin at its peak in November of 2021. The price proceeded to drop down to 1098.91 in June of this year (2022), the volatility of crypto is a danger that would be investors of the currencies should be wary of and take care to not be blindsided by.</p>
  <p>5.	A danger associated with the Proof of Work model for crypto is the side effect of a huge strain on the local power network. There have been several reports of “crypto miners” stealing power from businesses and everyday people. They run an extension cord from another building with power to one that doesn’t have it and set up a “mining farm” there. The mining farm consists of a lot of hardware with the sole reason of mining on the blockchain.</p>

  <h3>Future for Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain in rural areas</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Blockchain technology, while possible to appear and be used in rural and less progressed areas it’s likely to be prominent in more technologically progressive areas such as major cities and places akin to that. The technology that blockchain is made of is not likely to have much of an effect on rural areas for another 10-15 years at least. Blockchain will most likely see use in businesses and be talked about in schools first before being used in the other parts of a rural person’s life. </p>
  <p>Crypto is in the same boat as it’s not likely to be seen in an area which primarily focuses on farming and physical labour, unlike cities where you can find a lot more digitally inclined professions and systems that would be able to make use of the technology sooner. There is a very low chance that people will be going to the store and buying groceries with bitcoin or Ethereum any time in the next 15-20 years, as most people in rural areas aren’t that technologically literate as compared to people that grow up in cities with easier access to better and more advanced tech for a cheaper price.</p>
  <p>There is the belief that it will have an increased chance of usage with newer generations as they grow up with more advanced devices than their elders and others they know. The more tech literate children will be more used to the digital space and have a higher possibility of using both blockchain and crypto if/when it appears in rural locations at schools and businesses. The familiarity of similar concepts will provide them with a stronger sense of security with using them as opposed to the elders who are more likely to ignore them and not associate.</p>
