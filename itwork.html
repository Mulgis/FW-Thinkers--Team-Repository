  <p>Anne also holds several roles across various technical working groups where she contributes her subject matter expertise (SME) to the International Data Exchange Standards for taxonomy and flora systems across the globe. This often means you will find Anne awake at strange hours of the night trying to match the time zones from across the world as she passionately represents her field. Anne is also currently the Chair of the Australian Herbarium Information Systems Committee (HISCOM) where she meets with representatives from across Australia to oversee the implementation of innovative new technologies in the management of herbarium information and botanical research.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Anne's core role of Informatics Manager and Business Analyst sees her managing relationships with many different external stakeholders including cloud service providers, business owners, IT developers, cloud hosting support teams, policy developers, and data analysts, as well as specialists from biodiversity fields such as seed scientists, taxonomists, horticulturalists, collection managers and curators.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In Anne’s core role she has various supervisory responsibilities when interacting with her internal team. These include monitoring employee productivity, distribution of workload, ensuring compliance with company policies, and performance management as required. Additionally, Anne’s role requires her to interact with core internal departmental teams such as legal, policy, purchasing, procurement, and Chief Financial Office division.</p>
  <br>
</div><!-- / mem -->
  <p>Anne's secondary roles as HISCOM Chair and technical working group SME see her interacting with a range of national and international biodiversity specialists and representatives from organisations including the South Australia Government, Queensland Herbarium, Australasian National Herbarium, Maneeki Whenua Landcare Research, Australian Tropical Herbarium, Charles Sturt University, Northern Territory Government, Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Janet Cosh Herbarium, UNSW Sydney, La Trobe University, University of New Zealand, Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, University of Melbourne, Macquarie University, Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney, University of New England, Western Australian Herbarium, and the University of Sydney (HISCOM, n.d.).</p>
  <br>
  <p>Anne’s core role sees her spending a large amount of time completing requirements gathering, determining solutions, and implementing systems to provide efficiencies and value to her key stakeholders to uplift data sharing capabilities across Australia. Anne also spends a significant amount of time on administrative work, including financial and contract management, personnel and supervisory management, and stakeholder management. Anne’s secondary roles see her spending any remaining time managing relationships with key stakeholders, providing advice on biodiversity best practices, and managing inter-relationships between national and international biodiversity systems.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In Anne’s role of Informatics Manager and Business Analyst there are ongoing challenges when navigating the Australian political landscape, that is predominately subjugated by non-environmentalists, which has led to extensive funding cuts over the past 20 years for the Department of Agriculture, Water, and the Environment. This has led to extensive challenges when resourcing Anne’s team as low-moderate salaries are not enticing enough in the current job market to attract the quality talent that they require to complete the roles. There is also very limited availability of IT Developers who understand biodiversity which means Anne is unable to maximise the leveraging of skills to develop appropriate solutions for data sharing.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Anne is extremely passionate about the role she plays in protecting the biodiversity of Australian flora, and the discussions she is involved in on the international stage around Technical Working Groups and Data Exchange Standards. Anne also loves the contribution she makes, through the development of data sharing systems, for ecological research, and resource management around Australia.</p>
