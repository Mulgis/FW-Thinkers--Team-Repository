  <h1>Our Methods</h1>
  </header>

<p>The FW:Thinkers collectively were impressed and pleased with their efforts in completing the previous assignment. There were no major personal or professional conflicts, and they were able to dynamically manage their workload, and allocate tasks thoughtfully to facilitate each member’s individual strengths and weaknesses.
  </p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Tackling their next assigned project was predicted to be a larger undertaking, and the group decided to conduct a collaborative retrospective review. The aim of this retrospective was to encourage transparent reflection on the group’s processes, and identify strategies to combat areas of underperformance, and continue to foster areas of strength.</p>
    <br>

    <p>The FW:Thinkers used the “4 L’s” model to approach their reflection, which asks members to identify the things they liked, lacked, learned and longed for in the group process, on an individual level and as a unit. The results were as follows.  </p>

  <br><br><br>
    <p>The results of the retrospective illustrate a unanimous opinion of the groups strengths and weaknesses. The team was then able to plan the completion of their next project using strategies that would assist the team in their processes, by referring to the results and brainstorming thoughtful changes to methodology.  </p>

    <br>
    <p>The team was able to assess the behaviours and practices recognised as being positive and helpful to the team and commit to continued encouragement of these aspects throughout the completion of the upcoming project. All team members were willing and comfortable asking for feedback and critique on their work, allowing improvement and development of ideas and quality. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Team members are understanding and proceed with empathy when there are struggles to complete certain tasks. Best efforts are made to divide and assign tasks fairly to prevent any one member pushing themselves too hard and becoming psychologically burnt out.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The high morale and work ethic contributes to smooth production of materials and frictionless discussion, and the overall attitude towards group work remains positive. The team learned that addressing issues as early as possible is the most efficient way to prevent a problem from building and snowballing. The sense of camaraderie between members has allowed the team to approach learning areas with increased morale and courage and makes the process of attempting new practices less daunting, and more worthwhile.  </p>
    <br>
    <p>Recognising the areas of weakness, and the ideas that were missing and needed from the group process allowed the FW:Thinkers to commit the following changes to their methods. A collaborative agenda document was created within MS teams, to allow all members to insert input to the following meeting’s agenda and create a more linear and defined meeting structure, encouraging more input from all members.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Within the same collaborative document, an action plan was created, with each actionable item being logged and assigned to a team member each meeting, to address the issue of poor task tracking. Ideally this log will empower each member to quickly find any work they had been assigned and increase accountability to meet internal deadlines. The team will also be able to identify team members who had capacity for extra tasks as required, to prevent any team member being underutilised within the project.  </p>

  <br><br><br>
  <p>The FW:Thinkers are committed to focusing on implementing these changes to their methodology and looking forward to a further reflection on their ability to adapt their behaviours. Another retrospective on group process is scheduled to conducted upon the completion of this project, to allow the FW:Thinkers to continue assessing their performance, reflect on the impact these changes had to the flow of the project, and identify new strengths and weaknesses to continue improving their teamwork skills.  </p>
