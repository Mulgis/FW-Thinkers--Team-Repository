<p>The Fw:Thinkers worked remarkably well together in Assignment Task 2, having had no major conflicts and having dynamically managed workload allocations to compensate for each member's limitations and availability.
  </p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The Fw:Thinkers main change of process for Assignment Task 5 was to implement an action log to keep a more concise record of allocated tasks and timelines. This was to ensure that the previously observed slippage in Assignment Task 2 commitments was managed for Assignment Task 5, and everyone was kept accountable for commitments made. This also allowed the team to identify who had additional capacity for ad-hoc tasks as required. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Everyone in the team is very willing to ask for feedback on work they have done and to help others by critiquing their work, they can notice things that the person might’ve missed, and can better help guide them with what would be the best course of action for them to take. This leads to the quality of work being better overall as it’s never just one person’s POV on the work. During this process everyone is very understanding that someone can be having trouble with something and proceeds accordingly, no one is made fun of for not being able to do something.  The work is aimed to be handed out evenly so that no one gets burnt out from working too much and pushing themselves too hard. This when combined with the team’s good morale and work ethic leads to very smooth production of assignment materials as well as a good mental health for every team member in relation to the assignment materials. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Some of the things that we learned over time from the start of the A2 assignment is that when someone has a problem it is best to bring it up as soon as possible, this tackles the issue early and stops it from developing into a bigger issue later. We learned how to enjoy working as a group as we are pushed into situations that we are not fully familiar with. The sense of comradery that has developed has led to an increase in moral when it comes to working on assignment materials and has made things like learning and effectively utilising MS Teams a more worthwhile endeavour. </p>
    <br>
    <p>There were things we were lacking in, due to 3 of the 5 team members being introverted in nature there is a lack of input from all members on various topics and questions. While this hasn’t been proven to be a major issue it is something that can be improved upon. There is a tendency to not meet self-imposed deadlines exactly when they should be met, this can be rectified and should be as to provide a smoother experience with the work overall and ensure everything is done when it needs to be. The lack of strictness with meeting deadlines also leads to their being little time to fully overview everything and see what can be improved upon or fixed before the final submission. These 3 main issues with the team can be resolved easily but they are not major concerns as the quality of work so far has been above average and very sufficient, with these solved however, there can be improvements to the quality of the final product prior to submission.  </p>
    <br>
    <p>Things that we found could have been improved earlier but were not necessities were more structure to the team’s meetings as while there is a pseudo structure to them, it is not as rigid as it could have been. Due to the lucid nature of the team meetings we tend to spend more time in them then would be needed. There could have been more clarity on assignments and their marking criteria. Even when fulfilling the highest level of marking criteria for a certain area we would be off the full marks by a couple points due to the parts that we missed points on not being disclosed in the rubric. Tied in with the wanting of more structured timings within the team’s meetings there is the want of more efficient delegation of the tasks for each team member. The way it has been done so far tends to have some people take more of the work and some people have not as much. While the percentage difference of work done between the 2 people in this scenario is small it is something that can be improved upon. </p>
