    <h1>Single Board Computers</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      A Single board computer is simply a small form computer, with all components attached to a single circuit board. Single Board Computers (SBCs) have been rising in popularity since the early 2000s. They are generally cheap and simple computers which can be adapted to many purposes. They are best suited to use cases where a full computer system would be prohibitively expensive, unnecessarily powerful for simple tasks, or overly bulky for the physical space where the computing unit is to be applied (P.Abrahamsson, 2013)

      Many devices have populated the space in recent years including the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone, NVIDIA Jetson nano, Xavier and industrial NXP boards. The Arduino and Raspberry Pi in particular were both developed in the mid-2000s to solve the issue of a rising entry cost for students or enthusiasts wanting to get access to hardware that would further their learning or allow them to tinker. (Introduction to the Raspberry Pi, 2019) These two are now the headline devices in a widening market of small computers and microcontrollers. The creators of both devices had lamented the lack of fundamental knowledge students had when starting out in fields of study like computer science, programming and robotics. They individually came to the same conclusion that these students who had grown up in the 1990s and 2000s had not been able to tinker with cheap and accessible technology in the same way that students growing up in the 1980s had.

      While these tools were initially developed for a fairly small and specific group of users, they have been adopted in hundreds of different applications due to their low-cost beginner friendly development environments, as well as their open-source approach to development. (Gómez, 2015) There are many different configurations available within the space, but some common threads do exist. Many boards carry General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) headers to allow attachment of sensors, motors, speakers and other simple electronic components. It is common for boards to also have ports for flash memory like USB ports or SD card readers, allowing memory configuration that is optimal for the task. Some boards provide video outputs (HDMI, RCA,3.5mm Media port) so that a GUI (Graphical User Interface) can be used, or so that the device can handle visual tasks like streaming/scaling of video content.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      There is a lot of crossover in use cases for different brands and models of computer/microcontroller, but they have each managed to carve out a niche for themselves where they are most popularly used.
    </p>
    <p>
      For students, these tools have been applied in course materials to teach programming. Here they provide a simple, single board with all components clearly visible, helping students to tie theoretical concepts to real world hardware in a more tangible way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the field of robotics, the Arduino is commonly used to quickly and cheaply prototype or prove out concepts and test software before further developing the hardware specific to the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      More broadly these kinds of devices have been adopted as a cheap way to do-it-yourself when approaching new projects, from smart mirrors and home media centres to energy monitors and video game console emulators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The open-source approach taken by almost all of these devices has meant that thriving communities of developers have grown around them. The Raspberry Pi for example has grown a community of over 300 thousand contributors on their forums. (Jolles, 2021) Willingness to contribute to these open-source projects is high, as it benefits the community of users and developers. This support reinforces the idea of these devices as learning tools, as the community invests time into producing new resources that make the tools even more accessible and continue to bridge gaps into new applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The devices in this category, while not technologically ground-breaking themselves, have a disproportionate power to change the way things are done and drive innovation in many areas. This is due in large part to the ideologies that accompany them. Without the hacker/tinker culture working within an open-source framework these devices would not penetrate nearly as many industries or areas of study.

    <h3>Likely Impact</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>The combination of a cheap and powerful class of computer, combined with thriving development communities willing to apply the ‘hive-mind’ to solving a problem means that these units of computing are likely to find their way into many more places as time goes on. (Maceli, 2022)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The impact of these devices is already being seen, the Raspberry Pi is notable for selling over 40 million units and being the most successful computer produced in the United Kingdom. The sector as a whole is now estimated to be worth over 1 Billion dollars.  (Collins, 2022)
    </p>
    <p>
      The flow on economic impacts are far greater however, as SBCs allow rapid prototyping of devices, sensors and tools which help many businesses improve efficiency. The increase in innovation as a result of SBCs is inherently difficult to quantify, but there has been a significant increase in new products and systems using Single Board Computers in novel systems over the last decade.
    </p>
    <p>
    Single board computers have power as a teaching tool that will exhibit a much larger effect over time. As education incorporates these tools more, students will have greater understanding of computing fundamentals as they relate to single board systems. This leads to the designing of new types of SBCs and changes the computing paradigm generally. (Mitchell, 2012)
    </p>
    <p>
      These devices may prove to be of particular importance to developing countries, where limited financial resources can stifle innovation. Having access to cheap and powerful devices like these can open the way for innovative products, exploratory science, mechanisation and automation. This is perhaps the largest potential effect for these devices in the near term, considering the existing secondary markets for already cheap devices, as well as the existing ecosystem of teachers and developers. (Jolles, 2021)

    <h3>Personal Impact</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      At the individual level, SBCs will continue to provide a quick development pathway for innovative products. It is likely that new wearable technologies will arise directly from research and prototyping based on SBCs. Another area of development here is the health specific wearable technology. It is likely that more SBCs incorporated into homes will be used to capture health data which can later contribute to larger health studies. (AL, 2017)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Smart home/internet of things devices will experience accelerated development and adoption, both due to these devices allowing more user to easily test new ideas, and due to economic pressure exerted by users who can develop their own ‘DIY’ systems, resulting in a more competitive environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many more students will have exposure to these devices, promoting wider understanding of computer science fundamentals and making these areas of study more accessible. (Mitchell, 2012)
    </p>
    <p>
      For small businesses these small computers provide opportunities on many levels. Small scale automation is made easier than ever, and is supported by open-source communities, ever hungry for new ways to apply their skills. SBCs can be used to monitor and control many systems to make businesses more efficient. Everything from electricity consumption through to customer interaction can be monitored and to some extent controlled by systems built on these devices. (Butsenko, et al., 2020)
    </p>
    <p>
      Many physical processes within businesses will be good candidates for automation. Small scale automation is a viable prospect for small businesses as SBC become cheaper and more capable. As they are improved further, allowing interaction with a wider array of systems, they become more appealing for small businesses to purchase and implement. (Gómez, 2015)
    </p>
    <p>
      Single Board Computers have flourished over the past two decades, with very disruptive effects in many other industries. It is likely that these effects will become more widespread and more pronounced in the coming years, as mobility/portability, energy efficiency and economy become increasingly important in computing.
