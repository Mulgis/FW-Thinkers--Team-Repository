      <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
    </header>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The term ‘Machine Learning’ was first introduced in 1959 by a computer scientist named Arthur Samuel, who developed a rudimentary ‘AI’ for playing checkers, which learned and developed strategies with each game using a ‘minimax’ algorithm.</p>
    <p>Machine Learning is a component of Artificial Intelligence used to train machines, or software algorithms to perform certain tasks. This is useful when machines need to learn how to do something that isn’t easily coded in a ‘traditional’ way. This includes things like image recognition, where programming software is used to recognise each pixel to identify patterns, which would be virtually impossible for the human eye, but with machine learning it can be achieved.</p>

  </div> <!-- / intro -->
  <div class="content">
    <p>There are three main models used in machine learning:</p>

      <ol> <!-- numbered list -->
        <li>	<strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The machine is given a series of examples as ‘labelled’ training data to learn a function in order to match an input object with a desired value.
          <p>There are 2 subtypes: Regression and Classification models.
          Regression models are used to predict a ‘continuous quantity’. In this case, the ‘outcome variable’ is continuous.
          Classification models are used to predict a ‘class label’. In this case, the ‘outcome variable’ is categorical (can only have a value that fits into specific categories).</p>
          <p>Some examples of algorithms used by both types are decision tree, random forest and neural networks.
          Decision Trees are an algorithm with a hierarchical structure starting with a root node that branches off into ‘internal’ nodes, and then finally into leaf nodes.
          Random Forests combine the outputs of multiple decision trees to reach a single result.
          Neural networks are comprised of a collection of artificial neurons which process and transmit signals to each other.</p>
        </li>
        <li>  <strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> This is used to find patterns in the input data without references to labelled outputs.
        <p>The main methods here are Clustering and Association.
        Clustering algorithms are used to find ‘clusters’ of similar observations in the dataset, while Association algorithms are used to find ‘rules’ for determining associations in the dataset.</p>
        <p>Some common forms of clustering include K-means, and Hierarchical.
        K-means is used when there’s a fixed number of classes, while Hierarchical is used for an unknown number of classes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>	<strong>Reinforcement (reward-based) Learning:</strong> Reinforcement (reward-based) Learning: The machine uses feedback to improve via ‘trial and error’ and find a solution to the problem. The programmer sets rules for the machine to follow but gives no other direction as to how to find the solution.
              Thus the machine begins with completely random trials, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <br>

            <p>There are many high-end implementations currently available, here are some examples:</p>
            <p><em>AlphaGo</em> is a system designed to beat world-class players of the strategy game “Go”, an ancient Chinese board game with simple rules, calculated to have one sexquinquagintillion (2.1 x 10170) possible positions.
               This AI uses a combination of advanced search trees and multiple neural networks to decide on moves and predict the winner. The ‘Policy’ network determines move selection, while the ‘Value’ Network predicts success probability. The system was ‘trained’ using 30 million moves by expert players, and constantly works to discover new strategies by playing thousands of games between its neural networks.
              AlphaGo vastly outperforms other programs of its kind and is the first system to ever beat a professional Go player, predicting human decisions with 57% accuracy, which is record breaking.</p>
               <p><em>Dall.e2</em> uses diffusion to create artistic expressions and photo-realistic images from text descriptions or even edit existing images seamlessly, accounting for all factors including lighting, shadows, style/textures, reflections.</p>
               <p>Tesla (unsurprisingly) are making tremendous strides in AI training technology, revealing their new Dojo supercomputer last year. Using neural networks to train self-driving vehicles and even humanoid worker bots to perform hazardous/repetitive tasks.</p>
               <p>Considering the current rate of development, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to suggest that these things could be mass produced within a few years.
                  It’s not beyond the realms of possibility that we’ll see the development of automated crime prevention systems, capable of instant intervention whenever it’s determined that serious crimes are about to be committed. There are already predictive algorithms being employed by police to determine hotspots before crime even occurs, and where it is likely to occur in the future. This could potentially result in a significant decrease in vandalism, theft and violent crime.</p>
                  <p>It’s difficult to say who would be most affected by these changes.
                    Many low-income workers or people working in hazardous environments, may be put out of a job and need to find new career paths or education if worker bots are implemented across multiple industries. Criminals will be more likely to be apprehended with neural networks becoming more sophisticated and well trained over time.
                    Motorists and other road users will be far less likely to be involved in accidents with self-driving vehicles becoming commonplace.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Likely Impact</h3>
    <br>
    <p>As machine Learning improves, it opens the door for significant applications for technologies such as neural networks, robotics and autonomous vehicles across all industries, resulting in millions of new jobs and career paths, safer society, improved productivity, efficiency and quality of life. As neural networks continue to improve, they will also be extremely valuable for predicting disasters with increasing accuracy and significantly reducing violent crime, as well as casualties due to road accidents or hazards in the workplace. Unfortunately, it’s inevitable that learning machines will also get better at guessing passwords and performing other tasks that assist cybercriminals in all kinds of clandestine operations. On the flipside, cyber security will continue to boom, and protection systems and specialists will also grow significantly more capable of dealing with such threats.</p>
    <p>We may see a reduction in minimum wage occupations such as janitorial work or factory floor operations being filled by human beings, instead being handled by AI and robotic workers. This would of course bear a high initial cost to implement on a large scale, but trials have already begun and with the current rate of development in machine learning, this may soon be viable. Once mass production of automated workers begins, it would be highly advantageous in the long term. This means there will be a plentitude of job opportunities in robot maintenance and diagnostics to keep things running.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h3>Personal Impact</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Everyday life will be made easier in a multitude of ways, including smarter devices and delivery systems, including a marked increase in operation of things like drones and smart fridges.
      Drones have already been approved for use in specific locations, delivering groceries and medical supplies among other things. The ability to purchase items and have them delivered being so much more readily available and easy, could also result in less public interaction, with a danger of many opting to be more ‘isolated’ out of convenience.
      Improvement of search engines and personalised advertising, to the average person’s benefit or chagrin, possibly both. Improved road safety through increased availability of self-driving cars, also resulting in more ‘online’ time for many.
      With machine learning assisting with many other advancements, individuals uncertain about study or pursuit of higher paying jobs will surely be more inclined to take the plunge out of necessity.
      The growth and increasing financial viability of technologies such as Roombas taking care of the mundane aspects of life, will provide more time for betterment of self.</p>
