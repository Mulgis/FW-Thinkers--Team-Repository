      <h1>Our Project Proposal: PopSwap</h1>
      </header>



        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>When refreshing a wardrobe, there are two tasks to be considered: obtaining new items and discarding the old ones. The former task bears all the heavy lifting – the pieces you are not wearing anymore do not really belong in the wardrobe anymore, regardless of whether you discard them or simply shove them to the back. They no longer contribute to the overall collection of garments and accessories a person uses to create their outfits.</p>

        </div><!-- / intro -->
        <div class="content">
          <p>For most people, the current process has these two steps be completely disconnected. The focus is on the purchase of brand new, currently trending pieces, and the discarding of old unworn items becomes an afterthought when their cupboards start to burst. The idea for PopSwap was born from the simple idea to blend these two tasks together, and subsequently change the way people can approach updating their collections.  </p>

          <p>PopSwap is concept for a mobile application designed to be a cross platform, user friendly open marketplace. It is intended to be used as a platform for trading of second-hand clothes and accessories, with no exchange of money, only goods. The app will allow everyday people to find others to trade with in their area, to continue changing and updating their wardrobes without adding to mass clothing wastage or contributing to the fast fashion economy, all while saving money and rehoming unused items.  </p>

          <h3>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>PopSwap is a concept for a mobile application designed to be a cross platform, user friendly open marketplace. It is intended to be used as a platform for trading of second-hand clothes and accessories, with no exchange of money, only goods.</p>
            <p>The app will allow everyday people to find others to trade with in their area, to continue changing and updating their wardrobes without adding to mass clothing wastage or contributing to the fast fashion economy, all while saving money and rehoming unused items.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h3>Our Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Fashion is a constantly growing and evolving global industry, with a major environmental impact. Globally, 80 billion new garments are purchased each year (Bick, et al., 2018) and the average Australian acquires 27 kilograms of new clothing every year, with 23 kilograms of their old clothing ending up in a landfill (Australian Government, DCCEEW, 2021). The fast fashion industry is proponent of this overconsumption, with many e-commerce retailers offering cheap clothing just days after its inspirations were seen on catwalks. The fast fashion industry relies on impulse buying, encouraging consumers to stay on top of micro trends and consistently purchase new products (Niniimaki, 2020).</p>
        <br>
        <p>The fashion industry is estimated to produce 8-10% of global CO2 emissions, 35% of oceanic microplastics, and 20% of water pollution. Textile waste is also an increasing problem, with 22% of mixed waste in landfills globally being attributed to post-consumer textile waste, which refers to garments discarded after being purchased. It is estimated that 60% of garments are discarded to landfill within 3 years (Niniimaki, 2020).</p>
        <br>
        <p>The industry is a sustainability nightmare, but the hope comes from the increased demand for second hand clothing, with Australian marketplace gumtree citing that clothing, shoes, and accessories as their most popular items to sell, an increase of over 500% in sales since 2011 (Gumtree Australia, 2019).  This is an example of accessible technology facilitating in collaborative consumption successfully. “Collaborative Fashion Consumption” or CFC, refers to the alternative procurement of garments, through second hand marketplaces, gifting, or swapping (Becker-Leifhold & Iran, 2018).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Popswap intends to be a peer-to-peer collaborative fashion consumption marketplace, employing use of mobile app technology to create a community connection. With the creation of PopSwap, Australians can trade their unwanted clothing, satisfying their need for new items without contributing to the overproduction of new pieces, and preventing their old pieces from ending up in landfills.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The project is intended to not only blend the two tasks involved in wardrobe and style maintenace (obtaining and discarding) but also blending the old and the new, the real and the digital. Trading goods is a tradition old as time, and one that is overshadowed by profit and consumerism. Using the advances of the technological realm, the application can facilitate the resurgence of the practice of trading in the physical world. The project will mesh the digital space with real world communities. The creation and development of this project will show future employers an intention to shift the space of digital commerce in more ethical and thoughtful directions, which is proven to be on the rise as a service consumers value and look for access to in their daily lives. (Becker-Leifhold & Iran, 2018). </p>

        <h3>Our Competitors</h3>
        <p>When looking at current options for technology facilitated clothing trade, there were several reputable websites with similar missions, but different methodology. The most popular websites being consignment style, where a user sends in their clothing to the company's headquarters. The user is then reimbursed with cash or an internal currency token when the item is sold. In these models the user is not responsible for organising the exchange, and in the cases of cash reimbursement, has no obligation to recirculate within the same economy. Several of these websites also require a fee to be paid per item purchased, likening them further to a regular second-hand selling website.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are a few successful applications with similar models to the proposed PopSwap, with the focus being on community-based trading and self-organisation, however some have since ceased operation. ‘Dig’n’Swap’, a bygone instance of the CFC model website that facilitated peer to peer communication and trading, charged $0.99 USD per swap carried out on the website., whereas another called ‘Swapstyle’ charged a monthly subscription fee of $10USD to access the services. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The following chart was assembled to compare the features and caveats of similar services that currently exist or were previously popular within the landscape of collaborative fashion consumption. Features that the service has in common with PopSwap are highlighted in green, while those that are not a part of the PopSwap model are highlighted in orange.</p>
        <br><br>
        <div class="cent">
          <img src="Images/compete.PNG" class="table">
        </div><!-- / cent -->
        <br><br>
        <p>When assessing the similarities and differences between these services, there is a clear divide between websites and applications that market themselves as swap-based economies, but in actuality are simply online consignment stores, and the websites and applications that focus on peer-to-peer communication and self-organised trading, most of which has similar available features and models. The way these consignment-based businesses market themselves is particularly interesting, with ’Swap’ often being in the name but not explicitly in the outline of the business process. This shows the market is aware of the interest in swap-based economy services, and there is demand for the product PopSwap intends to be.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The apps with the highest similarities to PopSwap are ‘Bandi’ and ‘This-for-That', two mobile applications with similar business models and delivery approaches. ‘This-for-That’ does have internal currency available, but it is only used when an agreeable swap cannot be negotiated, letting one user trade for the item using internal currency. ‘Bandi’ focuses less on individual pieces being traded, and more on matching users with what they refer to as a ‘clothes twin,’ in theory someone with similar taste and body size, to facilitate consistent trading between the same two people. Neither of these platforms are available in Australia.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The features that have the least instances within the landscape are the features PopSwap proudly displays as their main points of difference from their competitors, these being the value categorisation system (a completely unique aspect), the map functionality (used in different services, but not in this specific landscape), user ratings, and community creation. These features will be discussed in further detail in this proposal, to illustrate the ways in which PopSwap is an innovative addition to this marketplace.</p>
