      <h1>Project Proposal: PopSwap</h1>
      </header>



        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>PopSwap is concept for a mobile application designed to be a cross platform, user friendly open marketplace. It is intended to be used as a platform for trading of second-hand clothes and accessories, with no exchange of money, only goods. The app will allow everyday people to find others to trade with in their area, to continue changing and updating their wardrobes without adding to mass clothing wastage or contributing to the fast fashion economy, all while saving money and rehoming unused items.</p>
        </div><!-- / intro -->
        <div class="content">

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Fashion is a constantly growing and evolving global industry, with a major environmental impact. Globally, 80 billion new garments are purchased each year (Bick, et al., 2018) and the average Australian acquires 27 kilograms of new clothing every year, with 23 kilograms of their old clothing ending up in a landfill (Australian Government, DCCEEW, 2021). The fast fashion industry is proponent of this overconsumption, with many e-commerce retailers offering cheap clothing just days after its inspirations were seen on catwalks. The fast fashion industry relies on impulse buying, encouraging consumers to stay on top of micro trends and consistently purchase new products (Niniimaki, 2020).</p>
        <br>
        <p>The fashion industry is estimated to produce 8-10% of global CO2 emissions, 35% of oceanic microplastics, and 20% of water pollution. Textile waste is also an increasing problem, with 22% of mixed waste in landfills globally being attributed to post-consumer textile waste, which refers to garments discarded after being purchased. It is estimated that 60% of garments are discarded to landfill within 3 years (Niniimaki, 2020).</p>
        <br>
        <p>The industry is a sustainability nightmare, but the hope comes from the increased demand for second hand clothing, with Australian marketplace gumtree citing that clothing, shoes, and accessories as their most popular items to sell, an increase of over 500% in sales since 2011 (Gumtree Australia, 2019).  This is an example of accessible technology facilitating in collaborative consumption successfully. “Collaborative Fashion Consumption” or CFC, refers to the alternative procurement of garments, through second hand marketplaces, gifting, or swapping (Becker-Leifhold & Iran, 2018).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Popswap intends to be a peer-to-peer collaborative fashion consumption marketplace, employing use of mobile app technology to create a community connection. With the creation of PopSwap, Australians can trade their unwanted clothing, satisfying their need for new items without contributing to the overproduction of new pieces, and preventing their old pieces from ending up in landfills.</p>



        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The app will be free for cross platform download and use location services to show users listings in their area. Users can list the items they no longer have use for and include specific details about the item such as item type, size, age, and condition. Users can also grade their item into value categories determined by a letter, with A being $10 or less, B being $10-$20 and progressing through the alphabet incrementally. The value system takes away exact dollar value from the listing that other users will see, to deter from too much value comparison, encouraging a more flexible marketplace. This way users will have a rough indication of how much something is worth and can inform how much they want to trade for a particular item, without making it necessary for trades to be exactly equal in value.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The app will have several tabs at the bottom of the screen.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>PROFILE - where users can update their details and location, list new items or edit listings</li>
          <li>MAP - an interactive map showing listed items near them, within a certain radius. You can move around the map as you would on a booking website, to view listed items in certain areas</li>
          <li>SEARCH - Where users can search for items by type or size</li>
          <li>TRADES - Where users can access active trade offers and messages with other users</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Items will be listed within specific suburbs, to show users how far away an item is from them without disclosing an exact address. The physical trading process, (exchanging of goods themselves) will be the onus of the traders. Trades will be encouraged to be done in public places, but as any open marketplace, it is up to the discretion of the traders. A possibility for further development could be nation-wide trading, but the burden of postage would be on the traders and would require possible success of a local version of the app.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The process to request and accept trades will be as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>User1 can select an item they are interested in, and the app will notify the owner, User2.</li>
          <li>User2 can then see this selection, and they can look through the catalogue of User1's listed items.</li>
          <li>User2 can select the item/s in User1's profile they would be willing to trade for.</li>
          <li>User1 would be notified, and can agree to the trade, or continue negotiating with User2.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>To incentivise honest trades and behaviour on the app, each user will have a star rating on their profile, which will be crowdsourced from those they have traded with before. Take the example with User1 and User2. When they log the trade as completed, they will be prompted to rate each other. Ratings should take into consideration that the quality of the item matches its description and the conduct of the user at the swap.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The main barrier to CFC models is the lack of trust from consumers. People are wary of price-to-value comparisons, and quality and cleanliness (Becker-Leifhold & Iran, 2018). The rating system will be able to certify reputable traders and increase a level of trust in the other users in the community and encourage honest descriptions of value and quality of an item. Because of the like-for-like nature of the trading process, the model may not be flexible enough to accommodate certain scenarios, such as trading clothes that no longer fit you, as the user who might be interested in a size 22 dress, may only have size 22 garments to trade. Ideally, with the inclusion of bags, shoes, jewellery and other accessories, there will be variety to search and find things in other catalogues, that fit personal style and body size.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With beta implementations and revisions of the process, the app can be developed and edited to reflect these concerns and be a functional marketplace for all its users. </p>

        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>MongoDB (MongoDB Realm)</li>
          <li>MongoDB Atlas Device Sync</li>
          <li>Atlas App Services</li>
          <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
          <li>GitHub</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>MongoDB is a highly versatile open-source database with many services that will be employed to build the app. MongoDB realm is a lightweight database and can be used to build apps from scratch or within templates created with built in best-practices for specific languages. To facilitate cross platform usage the app will be built with the Realm React Native SDK template, using JavaScript. Realm can link with Atlas Device Sync, which allows client data to be synchronised within the Atlas database and the backend of the application (MongoDB, 2022).</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Realm app, with MongoDB database, will be hosted using Amazon Web Services, which will provide a Virtual Private Cloud for storage of the data and app code. AWS will facilitate secure and efficient storage of the database and allow information to be called quickly and easily. The programming of the app will require a Github repository, which can import realm and its app services (Amazon, 2022).</p>
        <br>
        <p>When a user documents and tags an item in the app, Mongo DB stores the document as a live object, this allows updating of the details, and ensures any updates to the data are current. The tags will be saved as indexes, and the Mongo DB Expressive Query Language (as opposed to SQL – Structured Query Language), will facilitate searching by said indexes. This will create the basis for the search section of the app, allowing users to search for items based on the indexes they are listed under, which can include size, colour, relative value and item type. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The indexing will also facilitate the map section, where the Geo-Spatial index of a document will determine where on the map it is shown, so users can find items nearest to them. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Atlas App Services has built in functions for user profiles using an authentication provider. This will assign each user a unique identity within the database and log them in as active users. Authentication providers can also facilitate third party log ins using OAuth2.0, to allow access through Facebook, Google and AppleID.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Using HTTPS endpoint functions, we can require authorisation from users for certain actions, such as confirming a trade or prompting a rating. The HTTPS endpoints will also make the messaging capabilities viable, by storing messages as strings and displaying them to the selected unique user.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The trigger service is a built-in function that will activate certain actions when documents are updated or entered that fit certain parameters. This will allow push notification to users, including incoming messages or trade requests. The process will ‘trigger’ the notification function within the code when a string is sent, or a request is made. Triggers can also allow users to be notified of new listings in their area, or in specific indexes they have elected.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The document will contain a link to the storage of the related images, which will be stored separately in the VPC using GridFS, a MongoDB service that splits large files into smaller chunks and accesses them when called (MongoDB, 2019).</p>
        <br>
        <p>The advanced efficiency and flexible scaling of MongoDB Realm will allow constant upgrade and improvement of the app, with possibilities for more sophisticated searching and data retrieval.</p>


        <h2>Skils Required</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>UX Design</li>
          <li>Front-End Development</li>
          <li>Back-End Development</li>
          <li>Testing and Debugging</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Software Development</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>For the app to be successful, it will need to be functional, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Functionality will require skills in back-end software development, and proficiency in JavaScript. Knowledge of the functions and app services of MongoDB will be required and can be found and studied in their extensive documentation on Realm React Native SDK, and Atlas App Services, and the Atlas Best Practices White Paper (MongoDB, 2022).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Accessibility and aesthetics will require implementation of thoughtful User Experience Design, to ensure that the process of navigating and utilising the app is simple and quick to learn. Front end development skills will also be required in the design and creation of the interface, to make the app visually pleasing and interesting, as the app will be heavily focused on images of listed items, they will need to be displayed creatively, with relevant information easily found.</p>

        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>A successful implementation of this project will create a space for people to be more conscious of their wardrobe, and their consumption. The app will allow people to continue to update or change their style, without needing to spend money or increase the number of items they already own and deter people from buying from fast fashion websites. The app will encourage people to alter their views on consumption, and this change in attitudes can slowly but surely affect large companies, forcing movement in the industry landscape. Ideally, the app will slow the acceleration of waste in the fashion industry and motivate people to be more mindful of their personal impact.</p>
