    <h1>Our Career Plans</h1>
    <p>The FW: Thinkers have a diverse set of Generalist and IT Specific Skills sets required for their identified ideal jobs.
    The Fw: Thinkers have all spent extensive amounts of time analysing market data on occupational pathways, conducting group discussions, and completing personal analysis on their career aspirations. These ongoing evaluations have led to an evolution in ‘Ideal Job’ determinations during Assignment 1, 2, and 3.</p>

  <h2>Ideal Job Movements</h2>
  <p>Between Assignment 1 and Assignment 2, Tyrell and John both determined that they would adjust their ‘Ideal Job’ choice after further developing their understanding of career pathways within Information Technology.  </p>
  <p>Tyrell altered his ideal job selection from ‘Network Admin’ to ‘Software Engineer’. This was due to his determination that he would like to pursue a career which presented a more challenging work environment, where he could further develop his problem-solving skills and technical literacy. </p>
  <p>John altered his ideal job selection from ‘Cyber Risk and Threat Analyst’ to ‘Front End Developer’. This was due to his determination that he would like to pursue a career which had more day-to-day elements of creativity and problem solving within his work. John also acknowledged that he no longer wanted to pursue a Cyber Risk and Threat Analyst role due to resolving that he deemed it to be a potentially high-pressure environment or excessively stressful career choice.</p>
