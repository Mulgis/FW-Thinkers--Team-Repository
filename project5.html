      <h1>Our Project Proposal: PopSwap</h1>
      </header>

      <h2>Our Pilot Approach</h2>
      <p>Initially mocking up a skeleton of our database system for user interaction, and UI for users to add profiles. This will be tested by having each member of the team create a profile and add new items for trade. Criteria for considering this test passed are inspections of the database to confirm that new user connections appear in the database and that parent child relationships between users and items are aggregated correctly.</p>

          </div><!-- / intro -->
        <div class="content">

          <p>After confirming the database interaction steps, testing moves to Item status indicators. Having added mock Items in our initial tests, we will be able to initiate a trade step between two user accounts and verify in the database that the parent/child relationship passes from one user to another. This step should also verify that the item status changes to unavailable at the moment of trade.</p>
          <p>While these initial steps can be carried out by team members themselves, further testing with uninitiated users will be necessary to determine how user friendly and intuitive the interface and overall process is. For this purpose a randomly selected small group would be ideal, and feedback should be collected on the process of account creation and item addition.</p>
          <p>In addition to the randomly selected group above, we would ideally source a small group of test users who are in our target demographic and already familiar with the trading concept, to gain insights into how our product fits with existing habits, attitudes, and the wider trade market. These final two test groups could be assembled by reaching out to existing communities on social media, putting out a call for test users of a new product.</p>

          <h3>Our Path Forward</h3>
          <p>The Fw: Thinkers have aligned their timeframes to the usual ‘Application Development Life Cycle’ (Anon., n.d.) (ADLC) process to estimate progress against design, development, testing, and deployment of the PopSwap application. The summary of the Fw: Thinker’s timeline estimates against the ADLC are as follows:</p>

          <br><br><br>
          <p>The Fw: Thinkers have already accomplished strong project foundations over weeks 1-6 of development. The team have progressed the definition of project scope, roles, responsibilities, and identification of potential risks. During weeks 7-15, the Fw: Thinkers propose the following implementation activities:</p>

          <br><br><br>
          <h3>Our Pressures</h3>
          <p>The Fw: Thinkers have utilised the below Residual Risk Rating Matrix to assess the Likelihood and Consequence of identified risks to ensure they are proactively managed and escalated through the correct project governance arrangements.</p>
          <h3>Risk Likelihood Rating </h3>
          <br><br><br>

          <div class="cent">
          <img src="Images/risk.PNG" class="table">
          </div><!-- / cent -->
          <br><br><br>



          <p>The app will be free for cross platform download and use location services to show users listings in their area. Users can list the items they no longer have use for and include specific details about the item such as item type, size, age, and condition. Users can also grade their item into value categories determined by a letter, with A being $10 or less, B being $10-$20 and progressing through the alphabet incrementally. The value system takes away exact dollar value from the listing that other users will see, to deter from too much value comparison, encouraging a more flexible marketplace. This way users will have a rough indication of how much something is worth and can inform how much they want to trade for a particular item, without making it necessary for trades to be exactly equal in value.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The app will have several tabs at the bottom of the screen.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>PROFILE - where users can update their details and location, list new items or edit listings</li>
            <li>MAP - an interactive map showing listed items near them, within a certain radius. You can move around the map as you would on a booking website, to view listed items in certain areas</li>
            <li>SEARCH - Where users can search for items by type or size</li>
            <li>TRADES - Where users can access active trade offers and messages with other users</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>Items will be listed within specific suburbs, to show users how far away an item is from them without disclosing an exact address. The physical trading process, (exchanging of goods themselves) will be the onus of the traders. Trades will be encouraged to be done in public places, but as any open marketplace, it is up to the discretion of the traders. A possibility for further development could be nation-wide trading, but the burden of postage would be on the traders and would require possible success of a local version of the app.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The process to request and accept trades will be as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>User1 can select an item they are interested in, and the app will notify the owner, User2.</li>
            <li>User2 can then see this selection, and they can look through the catalogue of User1's listed items.</li>
            <li>User2 can select the item/s in User1's profile they would be willing to trade for.</li>
            <li>User1 would be notified, and can agree to the trade, or continue negotiating with User2.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>To incentivise honest trades and behaviour on the app, each user will have a star rating on their profile, which will be crowdsourced from those they have traded with before. Take the example with User1 and User2. When they log the trade as completed, they will be prompted to rate each other. Ratings should take into consideration that the quality of the item matches its description and the conduct of the user at the swap.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The main barrier to CFC models is the lack of trust from consumers. People are wary of price-to-value comparisons, and quality and cleanliness (Becker-Leifhold & Iran, 2018). The rating system will be able to certify reputable traders and increase a level of trust in the other users in the community and encourage honest descriptions of value and quality of an item. Because of the like-for-like nature of the trading process, the model may not be flexible enough to accommodate certain scenarios, such as trading clothes that no longer fit you, as the user who might be interested in a size 22 dress, may only have size 22 garments to trade. Ideally, with the inclusion of bags, shoes, jewellery and other accessories, there will be variety to search and find things in other catalogues, that fit personal style and body size.</p>
          <br>
          <p>With beta implementations and revisions of the process, the app can be developed and edited to reflect these concerns and be a functional marketplace for all its users. </p>

          <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>MongoDB (MongoDB Realm)</li>
            <li>MongoDB Atlas Device Sync</li>
            <li>Atlas App Services</li>
            <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
            <li>GitHub</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>MongoDB is a highly versatile open-source database with many services that will be employed to build the app. MongoDB realm is a lightweight database and can be used to build apps from scratch or within templates created with built in best-practices for specific languages. To facilitate cross platform usage the app will be built with the Realm React Native SDK template, using JavaScript. Realm can link with Atlas Device Sync, which allows client data to be synchronised within the Atlas database and the backend of the application (MongoDB, 2022).</p>
          <br>
          <p>The Realm app, with MongoDB database, will be hosted using Amazon Web Services, which will provide a Virtual Private Cloud for storage of the data and app code. AWS will facilitate secure and efficient storage of the database and allow information to be called quickly and easily. The programming of the app will require a Github repository, which can import realm and its app services (Amazon, 2022).</p>
          <br>
          <p>When a user documents and tags an item in the app, Mongo DB stores the document as a live object, this allows updating of the details, and ensures any updates to the data are current. The tags will be saved as indexes, and the Mongo DB Expressive Query Language (as opposed to SQL – Structured Query Language), will facilitate searching by said indexes. This will create the basis for the search section of the app, allowing users to search for items based on the indexes they are listed under, which can include size, colour, relative value and item type. </p>
          <br>
          <p>The indexing will also facilitate the map section, where the Geo-Spatial index of a document will determine where on the map it is shown, so users can find items nearest to them. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Atlas App Services has built in functions for user profiles using an authentication provider. This will assign each user a unique identity within the database and log them in as active users. Authentication providers can also facilitate third party log ins using OAuth2.0, to allow access through Facebook, Google and AppleID.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Using HTTPS endpoint functions, we can require authorisation from users for certain actions, such as confirming a trade or prompting a rating. The HTTPS endpoints will also make the messaging capabilities viable, by storing messages as strings and displaying them to the selected unique user.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The trigger service is a built-in function that will activate certain actions when documents are updated or entered that fit certain parameters. This will allow push notification to users, including incoming messages or trade requests. The process will ‘trigger’ the notification function within the code when a string is sent, or a request is made. Triggers can also allow users to be notified of new listings in their area, or in specific indexes they have elected.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The document will contain a link to the storage of the related images, which will be stored separately in the VPC using GridFS, a MongoDB service that splits large files into smaller chunks and accesses them when called (MongoDB, 2019).</p>
          <br>
          <p>The advanced efficiency and flexible scaling of MongoDB Realm will allow constant upgrade and improvement of the app, with possibilities for more sophisticated searching and data retrieval.</p>

          <br><br><br><br><br><br>
          <h2>Skils Required</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>UX Design</li>
            <li>Front-End Development</li>
            <li>Back-End Development</li>
            <li>Testing and Debugging</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Software Development</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>For the app to be successful, it will need to be functional, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Functionality will require skills in back-end software development, and proficiency in JavaScript. Knowledge of the functions and app services of MongoDB will be required and can be found and studied in their extensive documentation on Realm React Native SDK, and Atlas App Services, and the Atlas Best Practices White Paper (MongoDB, 2022).</p>
          <br>
          <p>Accessibility and aesthetics will require implementation of thoughtful User Experience Design, to ensure that the process of navigating and utilising the app is simple and quick to learn. Front end development skills will also be required in the design and creation of the interface, to make the app visually pleasing and interesting, as the app will be heavily focused on images of listed items, they will need to be displayed creatively, with relevant information easily found.</p>

          <br><br><br><br><br><br>
          <h2>Outcomes</h2>
          <p>A successful implementation of this project will create a space for people to be more conscious of their wardrobe, and their consumption. The app will allow people to continue to update or change their style, without needing to spend money or increase the number of items they already own and deter people from buying from fast fashion websites. The app will encourage people to alter their views on consumption, and this change in attitudes can slowly but surely affect large companies, forcing movement in the industry landscape. Ideally, the app will slow the acceleration of waste in the fashion industry and motivate people to be more mindful of their personal impact.</p>
