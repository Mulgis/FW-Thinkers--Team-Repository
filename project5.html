      <h1>Our Project Proposal: PopSwap</h1>
      </header>

      <h2>Our Pilot Approach</h2>
      <p>Initially mocking up a skeleton of our database system for user interaction, and UI for users to add profiles. This will be tested by having each member of the team create a profile and add new items for trade. Criteria for considering this test passed are inspections of the database to confirm that new user connections appear in the database and that parent child relationships between users and items are aggregated correctly.</p>

          </div><!-- / intro -->
        <div class="content">

          <p>After confirming the database interaction steps, testing moves to Item status indicators. Having added mock Items in our initial tests, we will be able to initiate a trade step between two user accounts and verify in the database that the parent/child relationship passes from one user to another. This step should also verify that the item status changes to unavailable at the moment of trade.</p>
          <p>While these initial steps can be carried out by team members themselves, further testing with uninitiated users will be necessary to determine how user friendly and intuitive the interface and overall process is. For this purpose a randomly selected small group would be ideal, and feedback should be collected on the process of account creation and item addition.</p>
          <p>In addition to the randomly selected group above, we would ideally source a small group of test users who are in our target demographic and already familiar with the trading concept, to gain insights into how our product fits with existing habits, attitudes, and the wider trade market. These final two test groups could be assembled by reaching out to existing communities on social media, putting out a call for test users of a new product.</p>

          <h3>Our Path Forward</h3>
          <p>The Fw: Thinkers have aligned their timeframes to the usual ‘Application Development Life Cycle’ (Anon., n.d.) (ADLC) process to estimate progress against design, development, testing, and deployment of the PopSwap application. The summary of the Fw: Thinker’s timeline estimates against the ADLC are as follows:</p>

          <br><br><br>
          <p>The Fw: Thinkers have already accomplished strong project foundations over weeks 1-6 of development. The team have progressed the definition of project scope, roles, responsibilities, and identification of potential risks. During weeks 7-15, the Fw: Thinkers propose the following implementation activities:</p>

          <br><br><br>
          <h3>Our Pressures</h3>
          <p>The Fw: Thinkers have utilised the below Residual Risk Rating Matrix to assess the Likelihood and Consequence of identified risks to ensure they are proactively managed and escalated through the correct project governance arrangements.</p>

            <h3>Risk Statements</h3>
            <br><br><br>
            <p>Listed below are the risk statements which have been identified through the projects implementation journey to date.</p>
            <div class="cent">
            <img src="Images/risk4.PNG" class="table">
            </div><!-- / cent -->
            <br><br><br>
            <<h3>Our Engagement (Group Processes and Communications)</h3>
            <p>The Fw: Thinkers have established consistent and reliable communication channels and weekly catch ups to achieve project objectives to date, however, the team will be implementing a ‘hybrid-agile’ approach to introduce mandatory daily 15-minute stand-ups, via MS Teams, for the team to attend. These sessions will be conducted to ensure concise key priorities are communicated across the team on a daily basis, for the remaining 10-week timeframe.</p>
            <p>This approach will be coordinated in conjunction with the introduction of a Kanban board (through MS Teams) to track ‘tickets’ to document current tasking allocations, due dates, and processes for achievement, where required. This hybrid-agile approach will be introduced to: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pursue incremental change to maintain team momentum;</li>
              <li>Ensure oversight and alignment across the team on key priorities;</li>
              <li>Proactively manage dependencies and blockers across the team to ensure a clear pathway is in place for resolution;</li>
              <li>Provide recognition and visibility of team achievements; and</li>
              <li>Provide visualisation of workflow processes.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p>The Kanban will be utilised to track items through lifecycle ‘buckets’ including:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><span>Backlog –</span> Item needing to be completed at some point but not a current priority;</li>
                  <li><span>Not Started –</span>Item needing to be completed soon but not currently in progress;</li>
                  <li><span>In Progress –</span>Item currently a priority and being actively worked on;</li>
                  <li><span>Blocked –</span>Item that is unable to be progressed as it is blocked by a dependency; and</li>
                  <li><span>Complete –</span>Item completed to satisfactory standard as defined by the team.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br><br>

            <p>An illustration of a blank Kanban board with example ‘tickets’ in the specified ‘buckets’ is below:</p>

            </div><!-- / cent -->
            <br><br>
            <p>Any required additional ad-hoc messages between team members will also be managed through MS Teams, or via phone, to ensure adequate communications are maintained to the appropriate members as needed. </p>
