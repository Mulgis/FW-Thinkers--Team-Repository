    <h1>Our Project Proposal: PopSwap</h1>
    </header>



        <h2>Project Detail</h2>
        <h3>Our Goals</h3>
        <p>The FW:Thinkers goal for this project is to create a mobile application focused on community-based trading of clothing and other apparel items. The application will link the process of discarding of old clothes with the act of obtaining new items, to encourage a peer-to-peer collaborative fashion consumption model within communities and reduce over consumption and textile waste. The application will be cross platform, allowing users to browse a database of listed items, list their own, and connect with other users to trade items.</p>

      </div><!-- / intro -->
      <div class="content">
        <p>The goals necessary to achieve the creation of this project are as follows:</p>
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h4>MARKET OBSERVATION</h4>
        <p>To launch any endeavour without proper research into whether there would be a demand for it or not is tantamount to failure. Research into the field that the app would affect and be a part of is important as to address the potential size and scope of both the initial user base as well as the potential for growth of the application, to confirm feasibility of the project. Any required changes identified by market research should be implemented, creating a more reliable and research backed model of delivery.</p>
      </div><!-- / mem -->
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h4>DEFINING TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
        <p>To begin planning the development of the application, tools and technologies should be researched and selected. Defining these services early in the procedure will ensure the team has time to understand the individual steps required to utilise these services efficiently, and allow for integration compatibility to be assessed. The FW:Thinkers have selected MongoDB Atlas as the database they will build the app around, using Atlas App Services to link the database to the application and program its functionality and triggers. JavaScript will be the main programming language used for the backend and frontend of the application, ensuring cross-platform functionality.</p>
      </div><!-- / mem -->
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h4>CREATING DATABASE CLUSTER AND CONNECTIONS</h4>
        <p>Using MongoDB Atlas requires the team to create a cluster to house and configure the database within and setting up the connection style. PopSwap will use Amazon Web Services to create a Virtual Private Cloud to host the database and application. Setting up this connection requires linking the cluster to the cloud-based server with AWS. The database and server will also need to be linked to the application through Atlas App Services. This step in the process will allow the sending and receiving of data from the back end to the front end through the Virtual Private Cloud.</p>
      </div><!-- / mem -->
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h4>CONFIGURING DATABASE, CODING FUNCTIONS</h4>
        <p>Functions must be created in the back end of the application to allow the users and developers to manipulate the database, creating functionality within the app. Configuring includes building the ability to create user profiles, upload items to the database as documents, and creating functions that will carry out the trading process and prompts for users to input information such as user ratings. This aim will be achieved concurrently with linking additional services, and programming the application interface, to ensure integration and functionality.</p>
      </div><!-- / mem -->
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h4>LINKING ADDITIONAL SERVICES</h4>
        <p>To develop the further features of the application, the team will need to link additional extrenal services to the backend and frontend of the application. They will achieve this by integrating and embedding services such as trimble maps, to create the interactive map interface, and socket.io to work with the functions of the database and interface to facilitate push notifications and messaging capabilities. These features are important to meet the vision for PopSwap, and set it apart from other applications on the market now, but without them the application can still function at a base level, sacrificing a great deal of user accessibility and desired scope.</p>
      </div><!-- / mem -->
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h4>DESIGN AND PROGRAM INTERFACE</h4>
        <p>To link the backend to an application interface that is aesthetically pleasing, functional anduser friendly, a highly sophisticated interface will need to be designed with a focus on user experience. The agreed design will need to be programmed using JavaScript, and associated calls will need to be linked to their relevant functions in the backend. With the design and implementation of the interface completed, the team will be much closer to having a functional application to roll out.</p>
      </div><!-- / mem -->
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h4>TESTING AND DEBUGGING</h4>
        <p>With a functional base application in place, and all services linked and integrated, the app can enter serious testing and debugging, to ensure functionality and usability across the board. The testing will need to be extremely thourough, proving each function is capable of being run within the larger application, and all functions and services do not interfere with and hinder eachother when run in a string of actions. This will allow to team to iron out any glitches, identify bugs and determine areas of concern for when the product will be released at scale.</p>
      </div><!-- / mem -->
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h4>MARKETING AND ROLLOUT</h4>
        <p>Once the app has passed quality assurance testing, and is approved for release, a strategic marketing and rollout plan will need to be devised and implemented. Due to the nature of PopSwap and its reliance on users for the app to function then the marketing needed will have to be highly effective to attract more users. The team will need to conduct further market research at this point, and potentially purchase advertising space online, in public spaces and create exciting and eye-catching graphics to increase public interest in the product.</p>
      </div><!-- / mem -->
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h2>CREATING THE CONCEPT</h2>
        <p>The initial concept for this project was simply a mobile application that would allow people to connect with people in their community to trade clothing and accessories. The community-based trading process was the main imperative feature to be focused on during development of the idea, and any added features would only emphasise this goal, rather than detract from it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To create a peer-to-peer trading process with no middleman required, the platform would need to be as accessible and user friendly as possible. Unlike other second-hand economy websites such as Facebook Marketplace or Depop, users do not have the incentive of profiting off their old belongings, which can often be enough motivation to push through a longer selling process or put up with unintuitive UX design. The ability to take a photo of an item, upload it to the platform and monitor its progress all on one device would mean the entire process became much easier for regular people to get involved in, therefore the best implementation for PopSwap is a cloud server based, cross platform mobile application.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At a basic level, the app would be a database for people to list their unwanted items and search through the unwanted items of other users, to find a suitable trade. The app would allow contact between the users to negotiate and organise trading. After solidifying this as the base functionality of the application, it was time to investigate the market and see if any similar apps or websites existed and begin to add features to PopSwap that would increase functionality and set it apart from any competing products, without losing sight of the main goal: to reduce consumption and waste in fashion at the community level.</p>
        </div><!-- / mem -->
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h2>BASIC DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <p>Initially focused on the creation of the app interface, the developers began exploring options for a suitable framework for mobile app creation, that would allow the developers to utilise pre-programmed functions such as push notifications and profile creations. BuildFire JS was a leading option for this procedure, an open-source app builder which allows you to use html or JavaScript on top of existing framework, to minimise the number of functions required to be built from scratch. However, it became clear that the main driver of the app would be the database used to store and manipulate the information uploaded to the application, and the rest of the services including the interface itself, will need to be decided upon and designed with database integration in mind.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The developers went back to their research, looking for a database that was versatile enough to be able to integrate seamlessly with several other services, and be functional from an application interface. They decided upon MongoDB, an open-source database. MongoDB is incredibly versatile in terms of available services, and has existing frameworks for app creation, and cloud-based server integration. The Atlas App Services is a set of functions available to integrate any MongoDB Atlas Database into a functional application and can be used to build apps from scratch or using templates created with built in best practices for specific languages. Atlas Device Sync also ensures a consistently synchronised database, across any number of users and devices. MongoDB also has existing partnerships with Amazon Web Services, the preferred cloud-based server for the hosting of the application. which will provide a Virtual Private Cloud for storage of the data and app code. Amazon Web Services will facilitate secure and efficient storage of the database and allow information to be called quickly and easily.</p>
      </div><!-- / mem -->
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h2>ADDITIONAL FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY</h2>
        <p>The development of further features to create a more complete application was a lengthy process that considered many factors, including the main barriers to the success of similar trade platforms, ease of access for users, and encouraging honest and open trading. The current features of the application are listed below, with more detail about the reasoning.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>VALUE CATEGORISATION</h4>
        <p>The value categories are a distinct point of difference that sets PopSwap apart from other similar trade platforms. To encourage a flexible marketplace, a value categorisation system will be implemented to grade items by their estimated value. This ranking will remove the exact percieved dollar value from the listing, to deter users from attempting exact value comparison. Users can grade their item into value categories determined by a letter, with A being $10 or less, B being $10-$20 and progressing through the alphabet incrementally. This way users will have a rough indication of how much something is worth and can inform how much they want to trade for a particular item, without making it necessary for trades to be exactly equal in value.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>FILTERED SEARCHING AND BROWSING</h4>
        <p>To make the app as user friendly as possible and prevent users from having to scroll endlessly to find something they like on the application, a sophisticated way to find and browse items is necessary. The application will allow users to search by item type, and apply relevant filters to their search, producing a list of only the most relevant items. Choosing to view Items triggers an aggregation step in the backend to pull together appropriate Item records for display. The SQL of MongoDB allows and efficient searching, which will in turn create a more user-friendly application.</p>
      </div>
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h4>MAP FUNCTIONALITY</h4>
        <p>The initial idea for a map function was inspired by that of which you might find on a booking website. An interactive map that would have pinned locations for where an item is located, so you could gage how far you may have to travel to conduct a swap. The swappers listing their actual home addresses would be a breach of personal privacy of course, so this was retooled to become a broader map, listing only the suburb an item is located within. The locations could still be pinned on a map, but simply in the centre of the suburb itself, and not over the owner's exact location. A user's relative distance to another can also be shown when viewing their profile, in increments of 500m. For example, a person will be listed as 4.5km away, or 12km away, to give users a rough indication of distance and location, without disclosing personal information that could put someone in danger. The ability to instantly view which items are closest to a user will be another clear point of difference that sets apart PopSwap from comparable products on the market.</p>
      </div>

        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h4>PROFILE RATING</h4>
        <p>The main barrier to collaborative fashion consumption models is the lack of trust from consumers. People are wary of price-to-value comparisons, and quality and cleanliness (Becker-Leifhold & Iran, 2018). The rating system will be able to certify reputable traders and increase a level of trust in the other users in the community and encourage honest descriptions of value and quality of an item. A feature invented to incentivise polite and courteous behaviour, as well as honest trading, is the user rating system. Each user will have a star rating on their profile, which will be crowdsourced from users they have swapped with previously. Once a trade is agreed upon and both users have confirmed that the goods have changed hands, both parties will be prompted to review the other, taking into consideration the conduct of the user, and whether or not the item matches the one listed on the site.</p>
      </div><!-- / mem -->
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h4>COMMUNITIES</h4>
        <p>An early idea for another tab in the application was a social feed, where users could post items they had found on PopSwap, and upload images of ways they had worn their latest items. Users could follow others on the app, and their posts would show up in the social feed tab. The thinking behind this development was to further create a sense of community within the app and continue to motivate users to trade. The idea was eventually considered to be superfluous to the main goal, and redundant.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Most users would surely have several other forms of social media to post their outfits and find on, and they should be encouraged to do so on other platforms, as a subtle way of advertising the PopSwap application on different social media websites. The social feed did transform into the idea to create smaller communities within the application, by giving users the ability to form groups based on similar styles and interests. The communities will allow people to have easier connections with the users they are most likely to trade with.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Items posted in the application can be shared within a community, giving them a higher chance to be seen by the people who will be the most interested in them. When looking at a functionally similar application, ‘Bandi’ their community aspect came in the form of matching specific users based on size and style and allowing trade between them. This idea, though clever on paper, ignores the fundamental reason most people might be discarding of an old item, it simply doesn’t fit them or isnt their style anymore. Allowing people to join larger communities to find items will prevent people from only being able to trade with users who have remarkably similar collections to themselves already.</p>
      </div><!-- / mem -->
        <br><br>
        <div class="mem">
        <h4>TRADE PROMPTS AND MESSAGING</h4>
        <p>The trade prompts are a vital part of the overall functionality of the application. This process will rely on trigger functions built into the backend of the application to facilitate the trading process and allow users to be notified of trade requests, be prompted to accept or decline offers, communicate with other traders, and be prompted to rate other traders. The chart below outlines the steps in the trading process and it’s outcomes, using an example interaction between two users: Anna and Bea.</p>

        <br><br><br>
        <div class="cent">
        <img src="Images/tradechart.PNG" class="table">
      </div><!-- / cent -->
      <br><br><br>
      <p>At every step in the process, the app functions are responding to input from the users and triggering further prompts to carry out the procedure. The users will have the ability to message each other at every step of the process, to prevent blind re-negotiating. In this example, if Anna is not happy with the trade, and selects “CONTINUE NEGOTIATING,” they can then message Bea and suggest a different item to be traded for. The messaging capability will also facilitate communication regarding the physical exchange of the items, without the need for users to give each other their personal contact details.</p>
      </div><!-- / mem -->
      <br><br>
      <div class="mem">
      <h4>AREAS OF CONCERN</h4>
      <p>With the main functions and features of the app solidly defined, the team was able to begin to see areas of concern that may limit usability and feasibility.</p>
    </div><!-- / mem -->
      <br><br>
      <div class="mem">
      <h4>FLEXIBILITY</h4>
      <p>Because of the like-for-like nature of the trading process, the model may not be flexible enough to accommodate certain scenarios, such as trading clothes that no longer fit you, as the user who might be interested in a size 22 dress, may only have size 22 garments to trade. Ideally, with the inclusion of bags, shoes, jewellery and other accessories, there will be variety to search and find things in other catalogues, that fit personal style and body size, and this issue will be mitigated.</p>
    </div><!-- / mem -->
      <br><br>
      <h4>PROFITABILITY</h4>
      <p>Another concern for the team was being able to run the app whilst keeping it free for users. When researching the landscape the application would be operating within, it was found that several options charged users per swap, or added surchages in specific cases. It was important for the team to be able to provide the base services to users with no added charge.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Most free applications, unless requiring subscription to access services, generate income through two streams, In-App Purchases (IAP), and In-App Advertising (IAA). With IAP ruled out for this project, the obvious choice is to institue IAA with a Advertising Network, a third party company that sells publishers space to advertisers. This may seem like the simple choice to create enough revenue to pay for developers and maintenance of the application, as well as operating costs from MongoDB, AWS, and other services used in the apps development and continued hosting. The concern is the dilemna of ethics when choosing to display advertising on a application that aims to reduce consumption and consumerism in individuals.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The team needed a service that allowed the thoughtful display of advertising, with enough revenue to cover cost. Google AdSense is a publisher friendly service that allows developers to blacklist certain categories of advertising, and their preferences also facilitate more decisiveness from publishers regarding which apps will be displayed on their platform. The revenue split from Google AdSense is strictly defined, with 68% going to the publisher of the platform, and 32% going to Google.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Ideally this service will allow PopSwap to only display advertising for companies that fit with our message, and sell quality goods and services that don’t contribute to overconsumption.</p>
