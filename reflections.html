  <p>The Fw: Thinkers have chosen to apply a more structured reflection method for Assignment 3 and have found ‘The Four F’s’ (Greenaway, 2022) framework was best suited to address provided in Assignment 2. The framework uses the categorisations of ‘Facts’, ‘Feelings’, ‘Findings’, and ‘Future’ allow precise examination and analysis of a situation. </p>

      <h3>Fw: Thinkers Summary</h3>
      <h4>Facts</h4>
      <p>The Fw: Thinkers group was formed in June 2022 to complete Assessment Task 2: Team Project (A2) for the Introduction to Information Technology subject at RMIT. The group consists of Louise, John, Tyrell, Kiera, and Thomas, who all come from different parts of Australia and are between 22 and 30 years of age. </p>
      <p>The Fw: Thinkers submitted A2 on time and received a grade of 77.5% out of a possible 100%. The Fw: Thinkers then decided to remain grouped for Assessment Task 3: Our IT Project (A3) and Assessment Task 5: Presentation (A5) to implement the feedback received and lessons learnt from A2.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Feelings</h4>
      <p>The Fw: Thinkers agreed that they felt very pleased with the continuing bubbly group dynamic which strengthened their ability to accomplish tasks and have open communication. The group stated that it was a very safe space to raise issues or concerns and felt that this was important in proactively managing the tasking to ensure that everyone’s requirements were being met across capability and capacity. </p>
      <p>The group felt that they could have done a better job of adhering to agreed deadlines for content inputs, however acknowledged that the majority of slippage occurred due to unplanned absences, from illness or life events. The group discussed their frustration around reduced capacity however agreed that physical and mental wellbeing is the priority and absences are unavoidable at times. The team ensured that ongoing discussions were had around the role this played in the final A3 report but felt that it had been well managed through the group’s proactive communication styles. </p>
      <h4>Findings</h4>
      <p>The Fw: Thinkers predominately attributed the success of the group to the open nature of communication and ‘self-nomination’ style of workload distribution. Combined with additional forward planning, action item tracking, and proactive re-allocation of tasking allowed a fast paced, enthusiastic, and harmonious group dynamic. </p>
      <p>The distribution of workload resulted in contributions of Louise 23%, John 20%, Tyrell 17%, Kiera 20% and Thomas 20%.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the group maintained a list of “nice to have” additions to ensure that improvements were captured if additional capacity was identified before submission.</p>


      <br><br>
      <h4>Future</h4>
      <p>The Fw: Thinkers determined that there were still ongoing developmental areas around the observance of content due dates across the group and suggested that this could be corrected in the future through a more deliberate approach to tracking action items, achievements, and deadlines to gain better visibility of slippage across tasks. </p>

      <h3>Louise Roser </h3>
      <h4>Facts</h4>
      <p>Louise was a part of the Fw: Thinkers for Assignments 2, 3 and 5. She often acted as chair of team meetings, ensuring each agenda item was discussed and actioned and meetings were recorded. She experienced difficulties meeting deadlines due to personal health issues.  </p>
      <h4>Feelings</h4>
      <p>Louise experienced moments of self-doubt and despondency throughout the project, due to feeling incapable of continuing her positive contributions to the group, and her performance therefore suffered. She was unsure of exactly how to express her opinions on specific topics due to lacking a strong understanding of them yet. </p>
      <h4>Findings</h4>
      <p>The group process functioned well with the addition of more structures and task tracking, however there was room for improved accountability with deadlines and work capacity. The experience overall was very pleasant, and Louise was proud of each of her team member’s dedication to producing quality work.  </p>
      <h4>Future</h4>
      <p>Louise has learned that personal issues can hinder someone's ability to work at their full potential, and this can foster negative internal feelings. In future assignments Louise aims to be more proactive with her time, and transparent about her health issues, to take advantage of the help offered by her teammates. She recognises that small changes to structure based on honest reflection can make a dramatic difference to the group process and plans to continue implementing these techniques in further group endeavours.  </p>

      <h3>John Wakelin</h3>
      <h4>Facts</h4>
      <p>John has been involved with the Fw: Thinkers for the completion of Assignments 2, 3 and 5. John has participated in all group sessions and predominantly contributed through website construction and video editing. </p>
      <h4>Feelings</h4>
      <p>Working with the Fw: Thinkers has been a very good experience from the start, and the atmosphere has remained positive and laid back throughout. However, John has struggled increasingly with mental and physical health issues, leading to significant self-doubt, and feeling that he was no longer pulling his weight and therefore letting down the team. This was eventually overcome, and he was able to continue making positive contributions toward the project completion.  </p>
      <h4>Findings</h4>
      <p>Initially, rigidity of task assignment was a source of motivation to push through and meet deadlines, but as the team has become more flexible it has improved performance and productivity, as well as coordination and collaboration between members. </p>
      <h4>Future</h4>
      <p>John has learned the necessity of asking for help from other members whenever there are difficulties or complications slowing down productivity and that shuffling of assigned tasks can be an effective countermeasure. He has also determined that he should continue to work on his time management skills to help mitigate these issues in future. </p>

      <h3>Tyrell Toomey</h3>
      <h4>Facts</h4>
      <p>Tyrell has been a part of the Fw: Thinkers team since the beginning of the A2 assignment and has worked on the A2 assignment, the A3 assignment & the A5 assignment. Tyrell has done his best to do the work assigned to him and has had no problem with asking for feedback and criticism on his work so he can improve it. </p>
      <h4>Feelings</h4>
      <p>Tyrell experienced heavy feels of self-doubt as he had more time than others and believe he should have been doing better work because of it. ADHD and anxiety also played into this as well. The team did a good job of helping him feel like he was doing well by providing feedback and made sure to encourage him to keep going. </p>
      <h4>Findings</h4>
      <p>The team’s work and efficiency had exceeded expectations. There were improvements that were made and more that could have been. The team meetings went smoothly but went longer than the maximum time limit, more structure to the meetings would have helped with this. The team worked better when everyone hopped around from one area to another as opposed to staying on one task.  </p>
      <h4>Future</h4>
      <p>There were improvements that could be made, though they aren’t necessary for the group to function. Meetings could have been more structured so they didn’t last as long, they could have been more often & the team could have communicated more outside of them. Aside from these I believe the team did very well. </p>

      <h3>Kiera Kruttschnitt</h3>
      <h4>Facts</h4>
      <p>Kiera is a 24-year-old woman from Canberra, Australia, and has been a part of the Fw: Thinkers group for the completion of Assignment Tasks 2, 3, and 5. Kiera has attended and actively participated in all group sessions, although has struggled with adhering to tasking deadlines due to ongoing illness and other life events. </p>
      <h4>Feelings</h4>
      <p>Kiera thoroughly enjoyed working within the Fw: Thinkers group and felt that the team worked extremely positively together through the open communication of requirements, constructive group discussions, and the friendly application of feedback when required. Kiera believes that the group actively built a very supportive team environment which contributed significantly to the easy-going nature of the group. </p>
      <h4>Findings</h4>
      <p>The Fw: Thinkers had ongoing issues with adhering to agreed deadlines, which was identified as an issue in Assignment Task 2, however deadline slippages in Assignment Tasks 3 and 5 were predominately due to illness or unavoidable life events, rather than being slack or inactivity.   </p>
      <h4>Future</h4>
      <p>Kiera believes that in future the group would benefit from the strict tracking of workload requirements, deadlines, and action owners to further drive accountability. This would future mitigate issues around slipping deadlines or late surges of effort before submission. </p>

      <h3>Thomas O'Connor</h3>
      <h4>Facts</h4>
      <p>Thomas is a 30-year-old man from Far North Queensland. He has been present for all but 2 team meetings and has worked collaboratively with all other members of the team throughout the assignments.  </p>
      <h4>Feelings</h4>
      <p>Thomas was very happy to work with Fw: Thinkers for both assignments. He felt his contributions were valued, and he particularly enjoyed the tight knit feeling that pervaded this group experience. Thomas felt that the groups eagerness to improve and learn was inspiring and motivated him to meet the effort of his teammates. </p>
      <h4>Findings</h4>
      <p>The systems put in place to keep the team on track were effective, but there were unexpected events which hindered the group, nonetheless. Thomas observed that the more flexible the group remained with allocated tasks, the less friction there was overall, and that changing the allocated tasks could result in a new surge of work being completed.  </p>
      <h4>Future</h4>
      <p>In future Thomas feels he should continue working on his time management skills, especially when working in a team environment when others may be relying on him to produce work at a particular time so that they can move forward with their own work. Thomas is much more optimistic about group working situations than he previously was and can even look forward to opportunities to work this way again.  </p>
