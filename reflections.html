  <p>The Fw: Thinkers have chosen to apply a more structured reflection method for Assignment 3 and have found ‘The Four F’s’ (Greenaway, 2022) framework was best suited to address provided in Assignment 2. The framework uses the categorisations of ‘Facts’, ‘Feelings’, ‘Findings’, and ‘Future’ allow precise examination and analysis of a situation. </p>

      <h3>Fw: Thinkers Summary</h3>
      <h4>Facts</h4>
      <p>The Fw: Thinkers group was formed in June 2022 to complete Assessment Task 2: Team Project (A2) for the Introduction to Information Technology subject at RMIT. The group consists of Louise, John, Tyrell, Kiera, and Thomas, who all come from different parts of Australia and are between 22 and 30 years of age. </p>
      <p>The Fw: Thinkers submitted A2 on time and received a grade of 77.5% out of a possible 100%. The Fw: Thinkers then decided to remain grouped for Assessment Task 3: Our IT Project (A3) and Assessment Task 5: Presentation (A5) to implement the feedback received and lessons learnt from A2.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Feelings</h4>
      <p>The Fw: Thinkers agreed that they felt very pleased with the continuing bubbly group dynamic which strengthened their ability to accomplish tasks and have open communication. The group stated that it was a very safe space to raise issues or concerns and felt that this was important in proactively managing the tasking to ensure that everyone’s requirements were being met across capability and capacity. </p>
      <p>The group felt that they could have done a better job of adhering to agreed deadlines for content inputs, however acknowledged that the majority of slippage occurred due to unplanned absences, from illness or life events. The group discussed their frustration around reduced capacity however agreed that physical and mental wellbeing is the priority and absences are unavoidable at times. The team ensured that ongoing discussions were had around the role this played in the final A3 report but felt that it had been well managed through the group’s proactive communication styles. </p>
      <h4>Findings</h4>
      <p>The Fw: Thinkers predominately attributed the success of the group to the open nature of communication and ‘self-nomination’ style of workload distribution. Combined with additional forward planning, action item tracking, and proactive re-allocation of tasking allowed a fast paced, enthusiastic, and harmonious group dynamic. </p>
