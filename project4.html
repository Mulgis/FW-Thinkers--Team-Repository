    <h1>Our Project Proposal: PopSwap</h1>
    </header>

    <h2>PROJECT FUTURE</h2>
    <p>At this point in the process of developing the PopSwap application, the team has completed several aims, and put progress towards several others. They have conducted market research, resulting in a detailed view of related products and a sharp vision for the application’s points of difference, and specific goals for success. They have defined the required tools and technologies and conducted research into implementation of these services, as well as integration capabilities and created a plan for gaining the skills needed to effectively utilise each service and language involved in the project development. </p>


        </div><!-- / intro -->
      <div class="content">
        <p>They have created an Atlas database and home cluster, connected it to Atlas App Services and Amazon Web Services, and are able to manipulate and interact said database through the MongoDB shell, using JavaScript, and using Android studio as a user.</p>


      <br>
        <p>There is definite proof of concept and progress towards the design of the interface, with prototypes and interface mockups created and assessed for user accessibility and design vision. Plans for testing and further development of the interface and backend functionality are made and timelined.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From this point, the team will need to create solid integration and links between additional services, program the interface and link JavaScript functions to call specific functions from the backend and begin testing and debugging the product.</p>
        <br><br><br>


        <h3>Our Structure</h3>
        <p>Roles have been difficult to assign for the entirety of the project, given the way we are approaching the process. As we review our progress each meeting, there is some predicted changing of hands for certain procedures, depending on who is better suited to the role, or how long a procedure will take as we obtain more understanding of the individual steps involved in its completion. As with many technical start up projects, the need to be flexible and ‘wear multiple hats’ is present.</p>
        <p>The roles involved in the project are often shared, and have certain overlapping elements, as described below.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Project Manager</h3>
        <p>The focus for the project is to create a functional database and be able to integrate several different services, linked to a cohesive and accessible interface. Due to the number of different services and processes required for the development of the app, a project manager is needed to be able to track progress, assign work and structure the team, and coordinate integration of all aspects.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Lead Developer</h3>
        <p>The process of configuring the back end of the app will be a large endeavour, so it is necessary to have one member of the development team who can be across all aspects of the project. This role will often overlap with Project Manager, as the team is small. The person who is across the project with the most knowledge of the steps required to be taken will be able to delegate and manage the whole team, not just those who are working in development.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Development Team</h3>
        <p>The app will need several people to work on the backend development in support of the Lead Developer.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Website Developer</h3>
        <p>This role pertains to the updating and maintaining of the Fw: Thinkers shared GitHub Repository and Webpages.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Front End Developer / UX Designer</h3>
        <p>The Front-End Developer is responsible for linking the user facing application to the backend of the database and its connected services. They will ensure functionality and usability</p>
        <br>
        <h3>UX Designer</h3>
        <p>To ensure the app us aesthetically pleasing and easy to learn and use, as UX (or User Experience) Designer is required.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Business Analyst</h3>
        <p>The Business Analysts role is to continue to fill gaps in market research, create a complete overview of the landscape to assist in further development of the concept, and ensure achieving the end goal is feasible</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Quality Assurance Specialist</h3>
        <p>The project will need consistent testing and debugging at every stage, especially as more services are added. To ensure the app is functional in all areas, the Quality Assurance Specialist will coordinate testing and trialling and ensure functionality across the board.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Marketing Specialist</h3>
        <p>A strategic and thoughtful rollout of the product should be planned and ready to action before the moment of completion of the development. The Marketing Specialist will work with the Business Analyst to ensure the features of the product that are most desirable can be advertised and shown to the public, and the application can be seamlessly introduced to the market.</p>
        <br>


          <h3>Our Minimum Viable Product</h3>
          <p>Time is a very limited resource in our development cycle, and it must be used wisely regarding work on the most necessary functions first. Once the app is in a functional state and has minimal bugs, if time allows it, we could see what features we could add within the time before launch.</p>
          <p>The minimum viable product to come out of this project involves the most basic functionality to allow trading. This includes user account creation and login, Item creation and aggregation, and Item status markers. Achieving this level of completion is the first feasible milestone which would be presentable to a target user. If any of these features are missing the utility of the app is limited, but getting these features right provides a great basis for further development.</p>
          <p>The team does not intend to create the tools for database management, rather it intends to use the existing Mongo DB system to handle these elements, as it is highly configurable and already provides comprehensive tools for this purpose.</p>
          <p>The user interface itself will be built from scratch, however it will draw on base activities available in app development software. This will save time laying out the basic structure of the app, and can still be modified to include activities necessary for later development.</p>
          <p>It has been decided by the team that it would be better to ship the product with less features if it means that it doesn’t spend another year in development. To that end, the initial Minimum Viable Product prototype will not include an interactive map to the level of complexity demonstrated by Google maps. A static map showing how many items are available in each nearby area is much more likely to be achievable in a short time span.</p>
          <p>For the purposes of this project, and given the time constraints, we intend for the app to be capable of managing interactions between only a handful of users, map functionality would be nice to achieve but will be allocated to the second phase of development. The top priority to begin with is user profile creation and item viewing / trade functionality. User interaction via profiles created by team members is sufficient to demonstrate app functionality. In addition, we will include figma mock ups of UI elements to provide a visual demonstration of what the functional prototype of PopSwap will look like.</p>
          <p>While the creation of the whole vision for PopSwap will not be fully achievable during this initial development phase, we are able to provide a working alpha/prototype build. This demonstrates the previously mentioned functions as well as the general “feel” we are aiming for with the user experience.</p>

          <h3>Our Delivery Approach</h3>
          <ul>
          <img src="Images/mongo.PNG" class="avatar2"><li>Mongo DB Atlas 6.0  - To setup database and provide initial framework for data storage. Thomas and Louise have a small amount of experience with this tool but will need to pursue the learning resources made available on the MongoDB website </li>
          <br><br>
          <li>Mongo DB Atlas CLI 1.1.7 – Used to interact with data, for some basic setup procedures, and to test specific functions to be called from the User Interface. As above, this requires digging deeper into the resources on MongoDB website.</li>
          <br><br><br>
          <img src="Images/squirrell.PNG" class="avatar2"><li>Android Studio Chipmunk 2021.2.1  -Used to prototype an app and interact with the database backend. Thomas has some experience building simple apps with Android Studio.</li>
          <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
          <img src="Images/js.PNG" class="avatar2"><li>JavaScript - Used to define and call all functions that interact with Mongo DB JS. Louise is familiar with JavaScript and will need to look deeper into the specifics of using JavaScript to interface with Mongo DB Atlas.</li>
          <br><br><br><br><br>
          <img src="Images/trim.PNG" class="avatar2"><li>Trimble Maps – Used to provide visual representations of Geospatial data and add to Mongo DB Geospatial functions to aggregate and display items by area. This is a new area for the team to explore.</li>
          <br><br><br><br>
          <img src="Images/socket.PNG" class="avatar2"><li>Socket.io – To be called by Mondo DB triggers for messaging and push notification purposes. This tool is new to the team, and will need to be explored further.</li>
          </ul>
