    <br><br>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>Cybersecurity has become an increasingly broadly used term to describe many practices and states in the world of technology. Its implementation as a catch-all umbrella is the subject of much discussion, as academics and professionals aim to declare a more rigid definition, which can still contain the complexities of the many things it refers to. A 2014 article on Defining Cybersecurity argues that articulating a concise and unified definition will “enable an enhanced and enriched focus on interdisciplinary cybersecurity dialectics and thereby will influence the approaches of academia, industry, and government and non-governmental organizations to cybersecurity challenges”. (Craigen, Diakun-Thibault, & Purse, 2014)</p>
    <br>
    <p>In basic terms, cybersecurity is any practice undertaken to prevent or defend against criminal or conspiratorial attacks on technology and software. It can define the state of being safe from malicious behaviour in the cyberspace as well, although some would argue that safety is never truly assured due to the increasing challenges in cyberspace to protect digital assets and systems. (Rajaretnam, reservedA REVIEW OF DATA GOVERNANCE REGULATION, PRACTICES AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGIES FOR BUSINESSES: AN AUSTRALIAN PERSPECTIVE, 2020)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Attacks on digital assets are undertaken for varying reasons, often to obtain personal and private information from individuals or businesses for the purpose of extortion, or the altering of sensitive data and the disruption of workflows within businesses and national infrastructure. (Craigen, Diakun-Thibault, & Purse, 2014)</p>
    <br>
    <p>For the individual, cybersecurity practices are often carried out without much of a thought. Every time you access an account requiring a two-factor authentication, you are practicing cybersecurity. Recommendations from the Australian government, in association with the Australian Cyber Security Centre state that individuals start by setting up two factor authentication, regularly backup their devices to clouds or external hard drives, and keep their devices locked and updated regularly. (Australian Government, 2022)</p>
    <br>
    <p>The recommendations for businesses are much more extensive (Australian Government, 2021), due to the harm a cyber incident can have on a business and its customer base. The amount of personal information even a small business stores, and the lack of funding or attention given to cybersecurity at this level, makes them desirable and easy targets for malware and ransomware. (Raghavan, Desai, & Rajkumar, 2017)</p>
    <br>
    <p>or businesses with e-commerce platforms, the threat of cybercrime is growing, and therefore having mounting effects on their profitability. Customers want to be assured their personal information is secure when completing online transactions, and businesses can respond to this by investing in the security of their online spaces and databases. (Ngahawatta, Lokuge, Warren, & Salzman, 2021)The threat to SME’s (Small and Medium Enterprises) is heightened when you consider that many do not have sufficient contingency plans in place to respond to an instance of cybercrime, and SME’s that experience can be ruined financially by an attack. (Raghavan, Desai, & Rajkumar, 2017)</p>
    <br>
    <p>A study performed jointly by Ponemon Institute and IBM’s Resilient Company took data from 2400 security and IT professionals working at SMEs across USA, UK, France, Germany, UAE, Brazil, and Australia to assess their capabilities to respond to and recover from cyber crimes.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>66% of the respondents felt that their organisations were not prepared to recover from cyber-attacks</li>
      <li>75% admitted that they did not have a formal cybersecurity incident response plan (CSIRP)</li>
      <li>52% felt that complexity of business processes is a significant barrier to achieving cyber resilience</li>
      <li>25% of the organizations have an incident response plan applied consistently</li>
      <li>23% have no plan at all</li>
      <li>14% test their plan for effectiveness</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>These findings show that despite the increased need for cybersecurity and the ever-present threat of cybercrime, businesses are struggling to keep up with cyber resilience. The barriers highlighted by the study were complexity of business processes, insufficient planning and risk assessments, and the complexity of IT processes. (Raghavan, Desai, & Rajkumar, 2017).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Comparable results are found wherever you look globally, with a study of Indian businesses in 2016 mirroring these findings. The Ponemon Institute features that “India’s economic growth rate combined with its adoption of digital technology has increased its vulnerability to malware attacks to be among the top 5 in the world.” (Raghavan, Desai, & Rajkumar, 2017).</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h3>Likely Impact</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>Cyberspace is rapidly evolving in its implementations and abilities; therefore, the impact of attacks and attack prevention is following the same trend. The increased need for cyber resilience in the home and in businesses and government has highlighted a skills gap in cybersecurity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In Australia particularly, we have seen an unprecedented rate of organised cyber-crime, from both international and domestic sources. The Australian Crime Commission estimates an annual cost of $15 billion every year, from organised cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure, espionage, and fraud.  (Australian Cyber Security Centre, 2021)</p>
    <br>
    <p>The impact of this is an increased focus on cybersecurity in government, with the 2020 Cyber Security Strategy pledging a $1.26 billion investment over the next decade to combat cybercrime, (Australian Government, 2020) and the appointment of the first dedicated minister for cybersecurity in the Australian cabinet in 2022. (Bongiovanni, 2022). The ACSC reports a 13% increase in reported cybercrimes in the 2020-21 financial year, bolstering the need for decisive action from governments to tackle the problem.(Australian Cyber Security Centre, 2021).</p>
    <br>
    <p>The response from the Australian government in their cybersecurity scheme pledges their commitment to actively defend critical infrastructure and highlights their intentions to focus on the barriers that prevent SME’s and individuals from fortifying their data against cyber incidents. With more collaboration from the ACSC they hope to shrink the skills gap in the industry and increase investment in cyber education. Strengthening the cyber skills workforce and creating stronger industry partnerships will empower SME’s to better defend themselves against cyber-attacks and reduce the impacts to the economy. (Australian Government, 2020)</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h3>Personal Impact</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>Within the community, the increasing rate of cybercrime, and further visibility of cybersecurity practices will hopefully result in a consciousness shift in the way we use our devices and store our personal information. A greater personal awareness of the risks of living in the digital space will have an impact on the severity of cybercrimes and reduce the risk of personal data being breached.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For Information Technology professionals and students, the focus on cybersecurity has presented countless opportunities for work in a wide range of positions globally. The field of cybersecurity is evolving fast, and growing faster, and developing a dedicated, skilled, and flexible workforce is a prominent and constant challenge facing the landscape of cybersecurity. (Vogel, 2016)</p>
    <br>
    <p>ICT Security Specialist are listed in the 2021 Skills Priority List with a strong future demand, experiencing current shortages in both metropolitan and regional areas nationwide (National Skills Comission, 2021). The demand for skills in cybersecurity will only continue to increase, as many businesses across Australia and the globe adapt with the rapid pace of digital advancement and embrace the practices of doing business in a digital world. The impact of such accelerated shifts in the skills landscape calls for consistent updating of knowledge and skills. The government Department of Industry, Science and Resources states in their publication on Australia’s Tech Future that “Individuals need to shift their thinking from having a ‘career for life’, to maintaining the skills needed to adapt to changing opportunities” (Department of Industry, Science and Resources, 2018).</p>
    <br>
    <p>The shift in the culture of education will impact many fields, especially in the world of IT, and encourage a more adaptable and relevant attitude towards education, upskilling and reskilling. The wide range of practices and varied skills required to create secure cyber environments will also highlight the need for a more well-rounded workforce, with professionals contributing through specialisation in certain desired skill sets. The 2021 (ISC)2 CyberSecurity Workforce Study notes four areas particularly desired for skill development and specialisation. (ISC2, 2021)</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Risk assessment, analysis, and management (26%)</li>
      <li>Artificial intelligence/machine learning (25%)</li>
      <li>Governance, risk management and compliance (GRC) (24%)</li>
      <li>Threat intelligence analysis (22%)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>The results of these demands, and further government investment in education will see the cybersecurity, and larger IT industry change the way they view their skill sets, encouraging an attitude of consistent and compounding improvement to keep pace with the rate of change in the practices of cybercrime. Cybersecurity is a field of expertise that will continue to be highly valued and crucial to the trajectory of the economy and the nation.</p>
