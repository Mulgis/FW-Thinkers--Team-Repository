<h4>student # S3966075</h4>
<h4><a href="https://loumangroup.github.io/LouiseRoserProfile/" target="_blank">Louise's website</a></h4>

<p>Louise is a 23-year-old who graduated from Year 12 in 2016, who then worked as a barista and café manager for four years in a variety of different environments. Louise then began a Certificate III in Cabinet Making in 2020. In her spare time, Louise enjoys yoga, video games, and several creative pursuits, including painting, writing, and woodworking. The Introduction to Information Technology course at RMIT is her first formal academic experience in the field of IT, and she is excited to learn more. Louise is hoping that this course and further studies in the field will help open her mind to realise how her existing creative pursuits can blend with the work of IT and programming, to create new pathways and ideas. Louise is aiming to learn and understand the workings of different programming languages and technologies and grow more inventive and creative ways to implement them in the future.

<h2>
  FW: Thinkers Profile
</h2>
<p>The FW: Thinkers have all completed testing across the Myers Briggs, Big Five, and Learning Styles assessments. The group outcomes and analysis are as follows:</p>
<div id="test">
<img src="Images/teststable.PNG" alt="table showing test results for each member" id="test2">
</div><!-- / test -->
<br><br><br><br>

<h2>
  Myers Briggs
</h2>
<img src= "Images/Personality_Type_Logician.png" alt ="Image of Logician avatar" class="avatar"/>
<img src= "Images/Personality_Type_Campaigner.png" alt ="Image of Campaigner avatar" class="avatar2"/>
<p>
  3 Analyst / Logician types. These types possess a vigorous intellect and offer unique perspectives. They seek stimulation intellectually and need freedom to pursue their ideas. They particularly seek opportunities to solve complex puzzles. A logician will do well in collaboration with others. They come up with insights and ideas rapidly, and may feel annoyed if forced to slow down and work out how these ideas are best implemented. In the longer term however, logicians can find better success when teams help them to take their time with these new ideas.
</p>

<p>
  2 Diplomat / Campaigner Types. These types like freedom and time to explore new ideas. They are open to trying new ways of doing things or changes in trajectory when necessary. Like any of the other personality types, Campaigners do suffer some frustrations. The most prominent of these is usually frustration at being micromanaged. They find joy in trying their hand at new projects, however as time wears on they are prone to losing interest and often find it difficult to stay motivated and avoid seeking new projects to excite them.
</p>
<br>

<h3>
  Indications from Myers Briggs tests:
</h3>
<p>
  The INTP type is generally private and very independent. This type prefers a logical approach to problems and people alike. Counter to this the ENFP type is characterised by being quick and impulsive, and loves to collaboratively devise new ways to approach problems. The group needs to be aware of this difference in approach to problem solving as there is a risk that ENFP types will misread independence as disengagement. Conversely INTP types may misinterpret an ENFPs impulsive approach as inefficient or illogical.  While INTP is likely to be motivated by the task at hand and work consistently toward completion, ENFPs are generally motivated by connection with the people involved and likely to lose interest once the initial shine has worn off a project. This difference can be a strength however, as constant collaboration can renew interest for ENFPs, and logically break down next steps for the benefit of INTP types.
</p>
<p>
  The Myers Briggs test tests do provide interesting insights into group member’s personalities and are potentially useful tools to better understand each other and avoid weaknesses. But they are not necessarily an accurate summary of a complete person, a complete group, nor of their potential for adaptation to the collaborative environment.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
  Learning Styles
</h3>
<p>
  The Learning styles test results show the smallest variation between group members of the three tests. Two members with Visual Learning style will be best suited to communication of ideas in a visual format and should be well placed if they can contribute to visual aspects of the project. Two members indicate Tactile learning style which, while limited in somewhat by the format, will be well suited to constructive and substantive tasks within the project. One member demonstrating a verbal/auditory learning style should be suited to understanding through verbal descriptions and be comfortable in meetings and communication with other team members.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
  Big 5 Personality Test
</h3>

<div class="big5">
<img src= "Images/B5_Group_Dynamic.png" alt="Graph of group average test reults.">
<p><em>Charts average Big 5 personality scores for FW: Thinkers</em></p>
</div><!-- / big5 --->

<p>
  The group average is well balanced, with high scores overall in the agreeableness and openness categories. This indicates that the team should have little issue sharing ideas and agreeing on a path forward. Conscientiousness is notably the groups lowest average score; this trait may be a stumbling block as it may slow progress if the team does not keep a firm schedule or agenda.
</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>
  Individually each team member exhibits a high score in a different dominant personality type. This is generally positively regarded, as teams with a wider range of personality types will offer different strengths and value to the team.  (Harper, 2019) Team members with higher Neuroticism scores provide structure for the rest of the team to follow and work within. Those with higher Openness scores should contribute to a welcoming team environment, and originality of ideas or insights. Higher Extraversion in some members should facilitate constant sharing of progress and provide a conduit between different elements of a project. Team members with high Conscientiousness scores should also help to keep the project progressing on schedule. Those with high Agreeableness scores will be able to work well with systems outlined by others and be good at following through on delegated tasks.
</p>
<br><br><br>
<div class="graph">
  <img src= "Images/B5_Kiera.png" alt="Graph of Kiera's test results" class="pent"><img src= "Images/B5_John.png" alt="Graph of John's test results" class="pent"><img src= "Images/B5_Tyrell.png" alt="Graph of Tyrell's test results" class="pent"><img src= "Images/B5_Louise.png" alt="Graph of Louise's test results" class="pent"><img src= "Images/B5_Tom.png" alt="Graph of Tom's test results" class="pent">
</div><!-- / graph -->
<p>
  Overall, this team composition indicates a well-rounded group, with few lacking areas. Provided a good schedule of progress is kept and all members of the team are kept informed and engaged by their peers, the team should work very well together.
